  description: |-
    The Robot Framework hybrid and dynamic library API gives more flexibility for
    library than the static library API, but they also sets requirements for
    libraries which needs to be implemented in the library side. PythonLibCore
    eases the problem by providing simpler interface and handling all the
    requirements towards the Robot Framework library APIs.
